# Way of Working

The group started off with a meeting to understand the assignment. During the meeting, some skeleton code was made to create a working environment using gradle for building, running and testing that everyone could use. An agile workflow was used where where tickets were created using GitHub's Project board [here](https://github.com/louiscb/DECIDE/projects/1) function and these issues were assigned evenly assigned between different members. Slack was used to communicate aswell as zoom after the first meeting. Some coding was done using pair-programming via Zoom, but most of it was done individually. The members kept in contact via Slack throughout for both planning aswell as for helping eachother. Towards the end there was a new Zoom-meeting where some additional tickets were made to polish the code and to have the right documentation. The tickets were assigned to different members.

According to the checklist the group is probably around stage 3, In use, in our way of working, descibed in Essence v1.2. The cheklist for In use, is the following:
"The practices and tools are being used to do real work.
The use of the practices and tools selected are regularly inspected.
The practices and tools are being adapted to the team’s context.
The use of the practices and tools is supported by the team.
Procedures are in place to handle feedback on the team’s way of working.
The practices and tools support team communication and collaboration."

The group fullfills all the items in the checklist expcept for the second one, since we haven't really evaluated/inspected our way of working. We should start doing that in order to clearly fullfill this stage and then move on to the next.
